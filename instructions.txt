Mid-term:
Program Requirements
* Must be able to execute from command line
* Takes 2 inputs, inputfilename outputfilename
* The program should read the input file for lines of expressions
* The program should only handle positive whole numbers
* The program should output the correct calculations (no order of operations). So, you can't simply try to use a function to calculate a string
* Do not modify the ReadLine() method. It uses regular expression which can be difficult to debug. I will not help debug regular expressions.

Handling failures:
if an expression can't be calculated correctly, due to exceptions or incorrect formatting, you should print error to the output file for that line.
if you receive the incorrect number of arguments, then you should print an error message to the console then exit

Test Requirements
* Must write test cases for Calculate() method. Should cover simple cases first, then more complex cases
* Must include 1 E2E test which takes an input file, calculates, then writes to the output file

How your program will be tested:
* Visual inspection
* I'll feed it input files and validate the output against my output files

Hints
* The code will not compile. Try to get it to compile first, then work towards fixing errors.
* Not everything in the provided files are correct. There is incorrect logic in multiple places
* Not all exceptions are handled correctly
* Consider characters when writing your programs
* Lever week6 but be careful because the programs don't behave the same
* if you get stuck, try to write your own from scratch. If that fails, reach out.
* Remember this program does not read input from the user but uses files. Do not use System.in
